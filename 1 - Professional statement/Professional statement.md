# **Professional statement**

Holding the principles of the CIA triad to high standards is the best way to explain my personality and lifeview. Confidentiality is one of the most important, under appreciated values of networks. I myself find confidentiality a very important principle in life as well, without confidentiality, you have no trust in anyone or anything. Integrity is another factor that no one seems to value. When doing research, you want to make sure everything is correct, yet it seems to be taken for granted. Again, I myself find holding the moral value of honesty being the most important personality trait. Without honesty, you have no integrity. Finally, availability everyone can understand, yet take for granted. When your device is slow to connect you get angry and frustrated, right? yet when the connection is stable you dont think twice about it. I strive to be available at all times, willing to help anyone at a moment's notice. With these goals in mind, i may not have the background other candidates may, but with my swift learning and moral values, I will be the diamond in the rough anyone is looking for. A thirst and desire for knowledge to advance myself as a person and in my career will drige me more than anyone else.
