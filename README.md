# **Jacob Puthoff's Cybersecurity Portfolio**

Within this Repository I have 9 different folders containing information and examples of hands-on experience I have gained through the google cybersecurity certificate course. Within each of the folders will be a hyperlink to open a Google Document with screenshots of my work. Within the files in each folder will be an explanation of what I am doing and my comprehension of each tool. 

## **Purpose**

I've always been very into technology and have so far loved every second of this field. In doing so, I have realized I use multiple principles in my every day life and my current job. The CIA Triad can be viewed in Truck driving as such. 

- Confidentiality

While I drive the freight to Point A to point B, wherever those may be, I am keeping the freight Confidential to outside factors or malicious actors if you will. This is by keeping a low-profile and watching my surroundings whilst being aware of potential threats to prevent any pirating or way that a customers freight could be compromised.

- Integrity

There are times when I get in a rush, we all do it. However, part of my job is verifying that the freight on my trailer is the freight going to the customer I am driving to next. This shows Integrity of freight where the customer knows that when we show up they will be getting the freight that they had ordered. 

- Availability

With deliveries comes delivery appointments. We strive to make all appointments on time to ensure our customers can rely on me getting there when they expect the freight to be there. This shows the availability in freight as they know when they order through us I will be there when they're expecting it to make sure they meet their quotas and own goals.

With these in mind I quickly realized that not only am I prepared for this job, I am perfect for it as I love the field and Tech work and I have been practicing concepts used in the industry for years and I am hoping for years to come.
