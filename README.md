**Professional statement**
I am an extremely self-motivated individual who strives for near-perfection while I also am eagerly learning anything and everything that I can at all times. I self-align myself with legal moral and ethical values based on everything and everyone around me at the given time. In previous jobs I had missed work due to a company being held by a ransomware attack and I want to be able to assist in preventing that in the future. I came to this field looking for a way to challenge and test my brain, gaining knowledge along the way. Learning swiftly is what I am best at and giving up is never an option, in addition I am always outgoing and great with other people, so I am confident I will make a great addition to any team while keeping any organization safe. I am currently in the process of completing the Google Cybersecurity certificate course, and plan to take the CompTIA Sec+ certificate after completion of the Google bootcamp.
